# Welcome to the Platform for Augmented Reality-based Learning and Knowledge Transfers

This repository provides sample applications and research about Augmented Reality (AR)-based learning procedures
improving knowledge transfers.

The tools were originally developed by Dr.-Ing. Marcus Grum.

## Applications

### ARCraft

This application supports the assembly of a furniture.
The example furniture refers to the IKEA product called `METHOD`.
Experiments have compared the assembly of paper-based and AR-based instructions.
With this application, and within an experiment setting, 
the paper shows how to improve the quantitative effects regarding the quality and amount of time needed 
for an example manufacturing process. 
Hence, it stands as a basis for the realization of adaptable knowledge-driven information systems
improving knowledge transfers autonomously.

#### Evaluation

For evaluating errors made during the assembly process, for instance, the following `yes / no` indicators can be used.

- Step 1
  - Were the side panels placed with the wrong sides facing each other?
  - Were the Cam Lock screws screwed into the holes for brackets?
  - Were the Cam Lock screws turned into the holes for shelf brackets?
  - Were wood screws used instead of Cam Lock screws?
  - Were nails used instead of Cam Lock screws?
  - Was a tool other than the one specified (red Phillips screwdriver) used?
  - Other types of errors

- Step 2
  - Were the angles installed mirror-inverted?
  - Were too few wood screws used?
  - Were the wood screws positioned in the wrong holes?
  - Were two angles attached to one side wall (right or left)?
  - Was an attempt made to attach the brackets using the holes for shelf brackets?
  - Was a tool other than the one specified (red Phillips screwdriver) used?
  - Other types of errors

- Step 3
  - Was the floor panel installed with the inside facing out?
  - Was the ceiling panel installed with the inside facing out?
  - Was the ceiling and/or floor panel installed on the right side wall?
  - Was the ceiling or floor panel installed separately on each side wall (right or left)?
  - Were the four prescribed wooden dowels inserted into the wrong holes in the ceiling or floor panel?
  - Were eight wooden dowels installed?
  - Other failure modes.

- Step 4
  - Were eight cam locks installed?
  - Were the Cam Lockt inserted the wrong way around (smooth side is on the outside)?
  - Were the Cam Locks not tightened?
  - Were the Cam Locks forgotten?
  - Were four Cam Locks mounted on the side for which a side panel has not yet been provided?
  - Was a tool other than the one specified (blue slotted screwdriver) used?
  - Other types of errors

- Step 5
  - Was the back panel turned the wrong way around (angle cutouts do not point to angles)?
  - Was the back panel mounted with the front facing backwards (white side is outside, brown side is inside)?
  - Was the side panel already mounted from the top (one step ahead)?
  - Other types of defects

- Step 6
  - Were the four prescribed wooden dowels inserted into the wrong holes (ceiling tile)?
  - Were the four prescribed wooden dowels inserted into the wrong holes (base plate)?
  - Was the side panel put on twisted ("In the plane of the plate" by 180 degrees)?
  - Other types of errors

- Step 7
  - Were the Cam Locks inserted the wrong way round (smooth side is on the outside)?
  - Were the Cam Locks not tightened?
  - Were the Cam Locks forgotten?
  - Was a tool other than the one specified (blue slotted screwdriver) used?
  - Other types of errors

- Step 8
  - Were the nails driven into the wrong place?
  - Were too many nails used?
  - Were too few nails used?
  - Were the nails positioned so that they did not grip the back panel?
  - Was a tool other than the one specified (hammer) used?
  - Other types of errors
