# Welcome to the Platform for Augmented Reality-based Learning and Knowledge Transfers

This repository provides sample applications and research about Augmented Reality (AR)-based learning procedures
improving knowledge transfers.

The tools were originally developed by Dr.-Ing. Marcus Grum.

## Applications

### ARCraft

This application supports the assembly of a furniture.
The example furniture refers to the IKEA product called `METHOD`.
Experiments have compared the assembly of paper-based and AR-based instructions.
With this application, and within an experiment setting, 
the paper shows how to improve the quantitative effects regarding the quality and amount of time needed 
for an example manufacturing process. 
Hence, it stands as a basis for the realization of adaptable knowledge-driven information systems
improving knowledge transfers autonomously.
